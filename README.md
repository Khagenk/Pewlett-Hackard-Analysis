# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# The purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to search a vast amount of company data to to help the manager figure out how many employees would be retiring soon in the near future. This analysis was preformed using pgAdmin software using SQL programing language to create series of tables, queries and using those to create other files. Ultimately they were all converted into csv. file and uploaded to Github.

In addition, given the total employee count of just over 300k Pewlett Hackard would be losing 1/4th of its employee due to the retirement. 

essentially the company would have to replace 72458 roles and mentors them. 

The analysis showed 1940 individuals who are eligible for mentorship program, so when the silver tsunami hit it would be difficult to replace our experienced retiring employee with new one immediately.
